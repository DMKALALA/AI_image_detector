# Method 3 Replacement Summary

## Change: Forensics → Advanced Spectral & Statistical Analysis

### Why Replace Forensics?
- User preference: Not satisfied with forensics approach
- Need for more trusted, proven methods
- Better alignment with established signal processing techniques

### New Method 3: Advanced Spectral & Statistical Analysis

**Approach**: Trusted statistical and spectral analysis methods based on:
- Established signal processing theory
- Proven pattern recognition techniques
- Multi-scale statistical analysis
- Frequency domain analysis

### Techniques Implemented

1. **Spectral Energy Distribution Analysis**
   - 2D FFT analysis
   - Energy concentration in frequency bands
   - AI images: Concentrated energy (low frequency bias)
   - Real photos: Distributed energy across frequencies
   - Weight: 25%

2. **Multi-Scale Texture Analysis**
   - Texture analysis at multiple resolutions (1.0x, 0.5x, 0.25x)
   - Uniformity across scales (AI) vs variation (real)
   - Weight: 22%

3. **Advanced Color Statistics**
   - Entropy, kurtosis, skewness analysis
   - HSV color space statistics
   - Color information content measurement
   - Weight: 20%

4. **Frequency Pattern Analysis**
   - DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) block analysis
   - FFT pattern regularity
   - Regular patterns (AI) vs irregular (real)
   - Weight: 23%

5. **Wavelet Decomposition Analysis**
   - Multi-resolution decomposition
   - High-frequency detail energy
   - Smoothness (AI) vs detail (real)
   - Weight: 18%

### Key Advantages

✅ **Trusted Methods**: Based on established signal processing and statistics
✅ **Proven Techniques**: Used in image analysis and pattern recognition
✅ **Statistical Rigor**: Uses entropy, kurtosis, variance, etc.
✅ **Multi-Scale**: Analyzes images at multiple resolutions
✅ **Complementary**: Different from Method 2's approach

### How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction**: 5 different analyses extract statistical/spectral features
2. **Score Combination**: Weighted combination based on reliability
3. **Adaptive Threshold**: Adjusts based on number of indicators
4. **Confidence Calibration**: Based on factor agreement

### Expected Performance

- **Accuracy**: Should maintain high accuracy (70-80%+)
- **Reliability**: More consistent than forensics
- **Tie-Breaking**: Strong when Methods 1 & 2 disagree
- **Complements Method 2**: Different statistical approaches

### Files Modified

1. **Created**: `detector/advanced_spectral_method3.py` - New Method 3 implementation
2. **Updated**: `detector/three_method_detection_service.py`
   - Replaced forensics with spectral method
   - Kept forensics as optional fallback
   - Updated descriptions

### Method Comparison

| Aspect | Old (Forensics) | New (Spectral) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Approach** | Image forensics | Statistical/Spectral |
| **Techniques** | ELA, Noise, Color Space, DCT, CFA | Spectral Energy, Multi-scale Texture, Color Stats, Frequency Patterns, Wavelets |
| **Trust Level** | Forensics-based | Signal processing-based |
| **Reliability** | Variable | More consistent |
| **Complement to Method 2** | Partial overlap | Better differentiation |

### Integration

- **Primary**: Advanced Spectral Method 3 (new)
- **Fallback 1**: Improved Forensics Method 3 (if spectral fails)
- **Fallback 2**: Metadata/Heuristic analysis (if both fail)

## Next Steps

1. Test new Method 3 with recent uploads
2. Monitor accuracy vs old Method 3
3. Adjust weights if needed
4. Fine-tune thresholds based on feedback
