# Method 3 Improvements Summary

## Analysis Results (Last 15 Images)
- **Method 1**: 60% accuracy (9/15)
- **Method 2**: 60% accuracy (9/15)
- **Method 3**: **100% accuracy (15/15)** ‚≠ê
- **Overall**: 60% accuracy

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Forensics Techniques
Added two new detection techniques based on research:

**CFA (Color Filter Array) Pattern Analysis**
- Real cameras use Bayer CFA patterns
- AI images may lack proper CFA patterns
- Weight: 0.20 (20%)

**Gradient Consistency Analysis**
- Real photos have more consistent edge gradients
- AI images may show inconsistencies
- Weight: 0.18 (18%)

### 2. Improved Threshold Logic
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on indicator strength
- Lower threshold (0.30) when multiple strong indicators agree
- Confidence boosting when strong indicators are present
- More decisive when Methods 1 & 2 disagree

### 3. Tie-Breaker Functionality
- Method 3 now acts as decisive tie-breaker
- When Methods 1 & 2 disagree, Method 3's weight is boosted 1.5x
- Method 3's confidence is boosted 20% when it breaks ties
- Final confidence increased by 20% when Method 3 is decisive

### 4. Weight Adjustment
- Method 3 weight increased from 6% to 13%
- Reflects 100% accuracy in recent samples
- Positioned as tie-breaker for Methods 1 & 2

## Expected Impact

1. **Tie-Breaking**: When Methods 1 & 2 disagree, Method 3 will now decisively choose
2. **Accuracy**: Additional techniques should maintain or improve 100% accuracy
3. **Confidence**: Boosted confidence when Method 3 breaks ties
4. **Reliability**: Multiple indicators provide redundancy

## Files Modified

1. `detector/improved_method_3_forensics.py` - Added CFA and gradient analysis
2. `detector/three_method_detection_service.py` - Added tie-breaker logic and weight adjustment

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Method 3 accuracy over next 50 samples
2. Adjust thresholds if needed based on feedback
3. Fine-tune indicator weights based on performance
4. Consider adding more techniques if accuracy drops
