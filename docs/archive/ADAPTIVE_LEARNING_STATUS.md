## 🔄 Weight Updates Applied

### Before Update:
- Method 1: **12.0%**
- Method 2: **80.0%**
- Method 3: **8.0%**

### After Adaptive Learning:
- Method 1: **12.9%** ⬆️ (+0.9%)
- Method 2: **78.6%** ⬇️ (-1.4%)
- Method 3: **8.6%** ⬆️ (+0.6%)

### Optimal Weights (Calculated):
- Method 1: 20.6% (will gradually increase toward this)
- Method 2: 65.9% (will gradually decrease toward this)
- Method 3: 13.5% (will gradually increase toward this)

**Note**: Changes are gradual (10% learning rate) to ensure stability.

## 📊 Weight Persistence

✅ **FIXED**: Weights are now saved to `method_weights_config.json` and will persist across server restarts!

**Configuration File**: `method_weights_config.json`
- Contains both method weights and confidence calibration
- Automatically loaded when service starts
- Updated automatically by adaptive learning system

## Recent Activity

### Latest 50 sample analysis shows:
- Method 1: **59.4%** accuracy ⭐ (significantly improved!)
- Method 2: **76.0%** accuracy (still best)
- Method 3: **42.0%** accuracy

**Note**: The 50-sample analysis shows different results than the 100-sample average, suggesting:
- Method 1 is improving in recent samples
- Method 2 performance varies by batch
- Recent feedback may reflect different image types

## ✅ Adaptive Learning Features

1. **Automatic Updates**: ✅ Working
   - Last update: 2025-10-28 (automatic)
   - Updates triggered when feedback is submitted
   - Runs every 24 hours if enough feedback exists

2. **Weight Persistence**: ✅ **FIXED**
   - Weights now saved to `method_weights_config.json`
   - Automatically loaded on service initialization
   - Survives server restarts

3. **Gradual Adjustment**: ✅ Working
   - 10% learning rate prevents sudden changes
   - Smooth transitions based on performance
   - System stability maintained

4. **Performance Tracking**: ✅ Working
   - Analyzes last 100 feedback samples
   - Calculates accuracy for each method
   - Adjusts weights based on real performance

## 🎯 Current Status

**The adaptive learning system is fully operational!**

- ✅ Analyzing feedback automatically
- ✅ Updating weights gradually
- ✅ Saving weights persistently
- ✅ Loading weights on startup
- ✅ Learning from user feedback

**Next automatic update**: Will happen when:
- 24 hours have passed since last update, OR
- New feedback is submitted and minimum sample threshold is met
