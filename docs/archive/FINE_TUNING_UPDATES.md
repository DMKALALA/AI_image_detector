## üîß Fine-Tuning Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Accuracy-Based Weights

**Previous Weights (based on 25 samples):**
```python
method_1: 0.22 (22%)
method_2: 0.57 (57%)
method_3: 0.21 (21%)
```

**New Weights (based on 45 samples):**
```python
method_1: 0.20 (20%)  # Reduced - still poor performance
method_2: 0.60 (60%)  # Increased - best performer, should dominate
method_3: 0.20 (20%)  # Reduced - still poor performance
```

**Reasoning**: Method 2's superior 72.2% accuracy warrants even more weight to maximize final accuracy.

### 2. Enhanced Confidence Calibration

**Previous Calibration:**
```python
method_1: 0.5  (50% reduction)
method_2: 1.0  (no change)
method_3: 0.6  (40% reduction)
```

**New Calibration:**
```python
method_1: 0.4  (60% reduction) - More aggressive due to 99.9% confidence but 67% error rate
method_2: 0.9  (10% reduction) - Slight reduction due to some false positives
method_3: 0.5  (50% reduction) - More aggressive due to overconfidence
```

**Reasoning**: Methods 1 and 3 show severe overconfidence, so their confidence impact is reduced more. Method 2 gets slight reduction due to false positives.

### 3. Method 2 Threshold Adjustments

**Previous Threshold**: 0.3 (30%)

**New Threshold System**:
- Base threshold: **0.35** (35%) - raised to reduce false positives
- Single indicator: **0.45** (45%) - requires higher score if only one factor
- Adaptive system based on number of indicators

**Reasoning**: Method 2's false positives (10 errors) suggest thresholds were too sensitive. Raising threshold and requiring multiple indicators reduces false positives on real photos.

### 4. Statistical Threshold Fine-Tuning

All statistical thresholds in Method 2 were adjusted to be **more conservative**:

| Metric | Old Threshold | New Threshold | Impact |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Color Variation** | < 15 | < **12** | More conservative |
| **Edge Density (Low)** | < 0.08 | < **0.05** | More conservative |
| **Edge Density (High)** | > 0.35 | > **0.40** | More conservative |
| **Texture Uniformity** | < 10 | < **5** | Much more conservative |
| **Brightness Uniformity** | < 20 | < **15** | More conservative |
| **Color Banding** | > 15 peaks | > **20 peaks** | More conservative |
| **Frequency Patterns** | < 100 | < **80** | More conservative |

**Reasoning**: These adjustments reduce false positives where real photos might trigger some statistical anomalies. The thresholds now only flag **extreme** anomalies typical of AI generation.

### 5. Multi-Indicator Requirement

**New Feature**: Method 2 now requires multiple indicators before confidently flagging AI:

```python
if len(factors) < 2:
    threshold = 0.45  # Higher threshold for single indicator
else:
    threshold = 0.35  # Standard threshold for multiple indicators
```

**Confidence Boosting**:
- 3+ indicators: Boost confidence by 10% (capped at 85%)
- 2 indicators: Boost confidence by 5% (capped at 80%)
- 1 indicator: Standard threshold, no boost

**Reasoning**: Real photos might have occasional statistical quirks. Requiring multiple indicators ensures we only flag truly suspicious patterns.

### 6. False Positive Protection in Weighted Voting

**New Feature**: Special handling when Method 2 predicts AI alone:

```python
if method_2_alone_ai:
    # Method 2 alone predicting AI - reduce confidence
    final_confidence = base_confidence * 0.85  # 15% reduction
    agreement_boost = "Method 2 alone - reduced confidence (false positive protection)"
```

**Reasoning**: Method 2's false positives often occur when it's the only method predicting AI. This protection mechanism reduces confidence in such cases.

### 7. Improved Agreement Handling

**Enhanced Agreement Logic**:

| Agreement Type | Previous Boost | New Boost |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Unanimous (all 3 agree) | +15% | +15% (unchanged) |
| Majority (2 agree) | +10% | +10% (or -15% if Method 2 alone) |
| Disagreement | -10% | -15% (or -25% if Method 2 isolated) |

**Reasoning**: Stronger penalties for disagreement, especially when Method 2 is isolated (known false positive pattern).

2. ‚úÖ **Require multiple indicators** (2+) for confident AI detection
3. ‚úÖ **Tightened all statistical thresholds** (more conservative)
4. ‚úÖ **Added false positive protection** in weighted voting
5. ‚úÖ **Increased Method 2 weight** to 60% (from 57%)

### Secondary Focus: De-weight Poor Methods

## üìä Monitoring & Validation

### Test New Uploads

The fine-tuned system will:
1. Use Method 2's 60% weight more effectively
2. Require multiple statistical indicators before flagging AI
3. Reduce false positives through threshold adjustments
4. Apply false positive protection when Method 2 is isolated

### Track Metrics

Monitor these metrics:
- **Overall accuracy** (target: 70%+)
- **Method 2 false positive rate** (target: <5 errors per 36 samples)
- **Confidence calibration** (should match accuracy)
- **Method agreement rates** (should see more unanimous/majority)

### Re-Analyze Regularly

Run analysis command periodically:
```bash
python manage.py analyze_method_performance --limit 50
```

Update weights if performance patterns change:
- If Method 2 accuracy improves ‚Üí increase weight further
- If Method 2 false positives persist ‚Üí adjust thresholds more
- If Methods 1/3 improve ‚Üí adjust their weights upward
