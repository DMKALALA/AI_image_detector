## üéØ Method-by-Method Analysis

### Method 1: Deep Learning Model
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | **32.5%** (26/80) | ‚ùå **POOR** (worse than random) |
| **Confidence** | 68.1% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Underconfident |
| **Best Method Selected** | 0% of the time | ‚ùå Never chosen |
| **Error Pattern** | 54 errors - predicting AI for real images | ‚ùå False positives |

**Issues**:
- Accuracy is below random (should be ~50%)
- Never selected as best method
- Still being used despite poor performance
- Modern ensemble may not be working (fallback ResNet-50 in use)

**Recommendation**: 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heavily reduce weight** or disable until ensemble is fixed
- Check if modern ensemble is actually loading
- If ensemble works, expect 60-70% accuracy; if not, disable Method 1

### Method 2: Statistical Pattern Analysis  
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | **70.0%** (56/80) | ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** |
| **Confidence** | 70.7% | ‚úÖ Well calibrated |
| **Best Method Selected** | 100% of the time | ‚úÖ Dominant |
| **Error Pattern** | 24 errors - mostly false negatives (missing AI images) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement |

**Strengths**:
- 70% accuracy is solid performance
- Consistently selected as best method
- Good confidence calibration
- Multiple high-accuracy factors

**High-Accuracy Factors** (65%+):
1. **`low_edge_density`**: **98.0% accuracy** (50/51) - ‚≠ê **EXCELLENT**
2. **`color_banding`**: **74.2% accuracy** (23/31) - ‚úÖ **VERY GOOD**
3. **`regular_frequency_pattern`**: **70.0% accuracy** (56/80) - ‚úÖ **GOOD**

**Issues**:
- Some false negatives (predicting Real when AI) - 24 errors
- Could improve AI detection threshold

**Recommendation**: 
- ‚úÖ **Keep as dominant method** (current 75% weight is appropriate)
- Boost `low_edge_density` weight further (already at 1.5x, could go higher)
- Boost `color_banding` weight
- Fine-tune thresholds to reduce false negatives

### Method 3: Metadata & Heuristic Analysis
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | **8.8%** (7/80) | ‚ùå **TERRIBLE** (much worse than random) |
| **Confidence** | 91.2% | ‚ùå Severely overconfident |
| **Best Method Selected** | 0% of the time | ‚ùå Never chosen |
| **Error Pattern** | 73 errors - almost always wrong | ‚ùå Complete failure |

**Issues**:
- 8.8% accuracy is catastrophically bad (worse than random guessing)
- 91% confidence but 91% wrong - severely overconfident
- Never selected as best method
- Current 15% weight is still too high

**Recommendation**: 
- ‚ùå **Disable or reduce to 5% weight maximum**
- Method 3 is actively harming the system
- Consider removing entirely or complete redesign

## üéØ Factor-Level Performance

### Method 2 Factors (Statistical Analysis)

| Factor | Accuracy | Current Weight | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **low_edge_density** | **98.0%** (50/51) | 1.5x | ‚≠ê **BOOST TO 2.0x** - Extremely reliable |
| **color_banding** | **74.2%** (23/31) | 1.0x | ‚≠ê **BOOST TO 1.3x** - Very reliable |
| **regular_frequency_pattern** | **70.0%** (56/80) | 1.0x | ‚úÖ Keep at 1.0x |
| Other factors | <70% | Various | ‚úÖ Current weights appropriate |

**Key Finding**: `low_edge_density` is performing exceptionally well at 98% accuracy!

   - Currently 10% weight (should be lower or disabled)
   
2. ‚ùå **Method 3 is catastrophic** (8.8% accuracy)
   - Much worse than random
   - Current 15% weight is too high
   - Should be 5% or disabled

## üîß Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. Update Method Weights (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current Weights**:
- Method 1: 10%
- Method 2: 75%
- Method 3: 15%

**Recommended Weights** (based on 80-sample analysis):
- Method 1: **5%** (reduce - poor performance)
- Method 2: **85%** (increase - excellent performance)
- Method 3: **10%** (reduce - terrible performance)

OR more aggressively:
- Method 1: **0%** (disable until ensemble fixed)
- Method 2: **90%** (dominant, reliable)
- Method 3: **10%** (minimal weight)

### 2. Boost High-Accuracy Method 2 Factors

**Current Factor Weights**:
- `low_edge_density`: 1.5x

**Recommended**:
- `low_edge_density`: **2.0x** (98% accuracy - extremely reliable)
- `color_banding`: **1.3x** (74.2% accuracy - very reliable)
- Keep others at 1.0x

### 3. Check Modern Ensemble Status

**Investigation Needed**:
- Verify if modern ensemble is loading
- Check server logs for initialization messages
- If ensemble not working, the fallback ResNet-50 is only 32.5% accurate
- Consider disabling Method 1 until ensemble is verified

### 4. Adjust Method 2 Thresholds

**To Reduce False Negatives**:
- Currently missing AI images (24 errors)
- Consider lowering threshold slightly (from 0.35 to 0.32)
- Or adjust factor weights to favor AI detection

## üìà Expected Improvements After Changes

**Current Performance**:
- Overall: 70.0%
- Method 2: 70.0%
- Method 1: 32.5% (hurting system)
