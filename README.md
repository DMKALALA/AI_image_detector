## API Endpoints

All API endpoints require authentication via API key. Set `API_KEY` environment variable.

- `GET /` - Home page with upload form
- `POST /` - Upload and analyze image (web form, CSRF protected)
- `GET /result/<id>/` - View detection results
- `POST /api/detect/` - API endpoint for programmatic access (requires API key)
- `POST /api/detect/realtime/` - Real-time detection API (requires API key)
- `POST /api/detect/batch/` - Batch detection API (max 10 images, requires API key)
- `GET /api/status/` - API status and health check
- `GET /api/stats/` - Detection statistics
- `POST /feedback/<image_id>/` - Submit user feedback (CSRF protected)

**API Authentication:**
```bash
# Set API key
export API_KEY=your-secret-api-key

# Use in requests
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-api-key" \
  -F "image=@image.jpg" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/detect/
```

## How It Works

The AI detection system uses **5 advanced detection methods** with weighted ensemble voting:

1. **Method 1: Deep Learning (EfficientNet/ViT/ResNet)**
   - State-of-the-art neural network classifiers
   - Trained on large-scale AI/real image datasets
   - High accuracy for modern AI generators

2. **Method 2: Statistical Pattern Analysis**
   - Analyzes pixel-level statistical patterns
   - Detects frequency domain artifacts
   - Identifies compression inconsistencies

3. **Method 3: Advanced Spectral & Forensics**
   - Frequency domain analysis (FFT, DCT)
   - Detects AI generation artifacts
   - Metadata and file structure analysis

4. **Method 4: HuggingFace Specialist Models**
   - Vision Transformer AI-image-detector
   - AI vs Human Image Detector
   - Fine-tuned on GenImage dataset

5. **Method 5: Enterprise-Grade Models**
   - Hive-style CNN classifiers
   - Reality Defender-style transformers
   - CLIP-based semantic inconsistency detection

**Ensemble Voting:**
- Weighted voting combines all 5 methods
- Confidence calibration for each method
- Adaptive thresholds based on agreement
- Feedback-based learning for continuous improvement

## Model Information

The application uses an **ensemble of 5 detection methods**:

- **Method 1**: Deep Learning models (EfficientNet, Vision Transformers, ResNet)
- **Method 2**: Statistical pattern analysis algorithms
- **Method 3**: Advanced spectral and forensic analysis
- **Method 4**: HuggingFace specialist models (ViT AI-detector, AI/Human classifier)
- **Method 5**: Enterprise-grade models (Hive-style, Reality Defender-style, CLIP-based)

All models are fine-tuned on the GenImage dataset for optimal performance. See `docs/FINE_TUNING_GUIDE.md` for training details.

## Documentation

For comprehensive project documentation including architecture, performance analysis, training guides, and development history, see **`PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md`**.

## Customization

### Modifying Detection Methods
Edit `detector/ai_service.py` to adjust detection algorithms and thresholds.

### Changing the AI Model
Replace the model in `detector/ai_service.py`:
```python
# Change this line to use a different model
self.model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("your-model-name")
```

### Styling
Modify the CSS in `detector/templates/detector/base.html` to customize the appearance.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Loading Errors**:
   - Ensure you have enough disk space (model is ~1GB)
   - Check your internet connection for model download
   - Verify PyTorch installation

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - The model requires significant RAM
   - Consider using CPU-only mode if GPU memory is insufficient

3. **Upload Errors**:
   - Check file size limits
   - Ensure supported image formats
   - Verify write permissions for media directory

## Performance Notes

- **First Run**: Model download and initialization may take a few minutes
- **Processing Time**: Image analysis typically takes 2-5 seconds per image
- **Memory Usage**: ~2-4GB RAM recommended for smooth operation
- **Storage**: Each uploaded image is stored locally in the `media/` directory

**Production Setup:**
1. Set `DEBUG=False` in production
2. Set `SECRET_KEY` environment variable
3. Set `API_KEY` environment variable for API authentication
4. Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` properly
5. Use HTTPS in production
