## Adaptive Learning System

### Overview

The Adaptive Learning System automatically improves the AI detector's accuracy by learning from user feedback. It continuously adjusts method weights and confidence calibration based on real-world performance data.

### How It Works

1. **Feedback Collection**
   - Every user feedback (correct/incorrect) is stored
   - System tracks which method made which prediction

2. **Performance Analysis**
   - Analyzes recent feedback (default: last 100 samples, minimum 20)
   - Calculates accuracy for each detection method
   - Tracks average confidence levels

3. **Automatic Weight Adjustment**
   - High-accuracy methods get higher weights
   - Low-accuracy methods get lower weights
   - Uses exponential function to emphasize differences

4. **Confidence Calibration**
   - Adjusts confidence multipliers
   - Reduces calibration if method is overconfident
   - Increases calibration if method is underconfident

5. **Learning Rate**
   - Default: 0.1 (10% blend of new weights)
   - Prevents sudden, drastic changes
   - Smoothly adapts over time

### Configuration

Stored in `adaptive_learning_config.json`:

```json
{
  "auto_update_enabled": true,
  "update_interval_hours": 24,
  "min_feedback_samples": 20,
  "learning_rate": 0.1,
  "last_update": "2025-10-28T15:00:00"
}
```

### Usage

**Automatic**: Runs automatically when:
- At least 20 feedback samples available
- 24 hours passed since last update
- New feedback is submitted

**Manual**:
```bash
# Standard update
python manage.py adaptive_learn

# Force update (ignores time interval)
python manage.py adaptive_learn --force

# Specify sample limit
python manage.py adaptive_learn --limit 200
```

### Current Performance

Based on 50 recent feedback samples:

| Method | Accuracy | Weight | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Method 1 | 56.7% | 50% | ✅ Best |
| Method 2 | 40.0% | 40% | ⚠️ Needs tuning |
| Method 3 | 33.3% | 10% | ❌ Needs improvement |

#### Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Update `SECRET_KEY` in environment variables
- [ ] Set `DEBUG=False` in production
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` with your domain
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Configure media file storage (AWS S3 recommended)
- [ ] Test locally with production settings

After deployment:
- [ ] Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
- [ ] Collect static files: `python manage.py collectstatic`
- [ ] Create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- [ ] Verify all features work on production
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors

#### Quick Start: Render Deployment

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Create account at render.com
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Create PostgreSQL database
5. Create Web Service with:
   - Build: `pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
   - Start: `gunicorn image_detector_project.wsgi:application`
6. Set environment variables (SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS)
7. Deploy!
